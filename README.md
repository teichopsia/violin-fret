# violin fretboard sandbox

this was adapted from a tutorial found [here](https://gist.github.com/ainsleymcgrath/a6b0d4a40f18f897aa8ec657da5b800b)

the goal of this was my attempt to write a tool in js
using d3 neither of which I knew from the onset. I make
no claim as to how best practice this code is. it works
for the original intent which was to assist me learning
fret layout for my violin as I could find no such tool
online to my dismay

the code is incomplete because of a variety of reasons
but to avoid losing it entirely I've archived it here.
if it helps you so be it.

at some point I'll add code to make savable urls for
specific fingering/chords instead of requiring source
edits but it wasn't a priority initially since I was
automatically generating pages on the backend

if you know a better tool for doing something like this
by all means point it out to me. my google bubble failed
me back in 2020 when i wrote this
